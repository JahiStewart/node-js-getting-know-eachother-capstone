            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p class="ex1">
                &emsp; I am Jahi Stewart, a senior, and the reason I became a Computer Science major is because I really love diving into complex problems or tweaking programs to make them work even better. Currently I work as an IT student worker and mainly do password resets and troubleshoot software. I am the eldest of four.
